# Curriculum: Responsive Web Design
## A repository to store the Responsive Web Design curriculum projects I built for freeCodeCamp.

This repository is for me to showcase the code I built when completing each and every project for the Responsive Web Design curriculum in freeCodeCamp. Each project (named in every folder) will have different folder structures depending on the date it was last committed. 

The oldest folder (when opened) will take you immediately to the source files of the project and the most recent will have source files whist having subfolders directing you to other source files.

Here is an outline from the oldest to most recent folders (each with a link that directs you to the project):

* survey-form > https://codepen.io/nyevergator/pen/ZEvBLPb
* tribute-page > https://codepen.io/nyevergator/pen/xxpoPLQ
* tech-doc-page > https://codepen.io/nyevergator/pen/zYRrgzr
* landing-page > https://codepen.io/nyevergator/pen/rNJKgxv
* portfolio-page > https://codepen.io/nyevergator/pen/oNERPgE

## Why is the structure of each directory/folder different?

I followed the layout of the Responsive Web Design curriculum. If the next set of exercises is about building a project website (e.g. a survey form or landing page), then I shall build it. For every project I built, I learned things along the way whether it is about making good commit messages, building better layouts using CSS Flexbox and Grid, or creating structured directories.
